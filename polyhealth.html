    <div class="container-portfolio-color">
      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p><strong>Cal Poly students need an easy way to schedule appointments, check in for appointments, and communicate with Campus Health & Wellbeing.</strong> Campus Health & Wellbeing is shifting towards scheduled appointments rather than walk-ins and the current system of scheduling is difficult to use. Along with scheduling appointments, students need to be able to check in and fill out forms at any location, not just in the Health & Wellbeing building. Students and healthcare providers also need an easy and quick way to communicate with each other to share important information in real time whether through text or video.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="container-portfolio">

    <div class="space"></div>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
    <p>We believe that by designing a new app for Campus Health & Wellbeing that allows Cal Poly students to easily schedule and manage appointments, seamlessly check in, complete forms, and quickly communicate with the healthcare providers, we can create a smooth user experience for students who visit the health center. We will know this to be true when we see the student feedback to be rated above average. The main goal of the app is to reduce time spent using the system and ease of use.</p>

    <div class="space-half"></div>

    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <p>Based on the competitive analysis, the direct competition to Campus Health & Wellbeing would be French Hospital owned by Dignity Health. They have a variety of apps that have a majority of the features we're looking to implement but all features are spread around multiple apps that can make it confusing to users.</p>
    <p>We also looked into Urgent Cares in San Luis Obispo because that's where students would most likely go to if not at Cal Poly. Most of their websites were outdated and didn't seem to feature any digital capabilities. A few did have patient portals that gave access to test results, making appointments and payments, and patient-doctor communication.</p>
    <p>Stanford Health Care MyHealth is considered indirect competition but it is a great model to look at considering it's for university health centers and it has all of the features we're looking to actualize.</p>
    <p>In an unrelated field to healthcare, Squire allows users the ability to find and schedule appointments with barbers. The app adds an interesting aspect that allows customers to pick different services with an allotted amount of time. Squire also features, appointment reminders, customers to send photos, and customer profiles.</p>

    <h4>User Findings</h4>
    <p>We interviewed 6 different individuals that had used the Health & Wellbeing Center multiple times throughout their time at Cal Poly.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only go to the Health Center if they have to</li>
      <li>Preferred because it’s ‘free’</li>
      <li>Use apps to schedule other services</li>
      <li>Hate long wait times</li>
      <li>Want more information about appointment availability</li>
      <li>Would like text reminders</li>
      <li>Think an app would make the Health Center appear more high-tech</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="background-slider">

    <div class="slideshow-container">
      <div class="mySlides">
        <q>“My local doctor uses an app by the Palo Alto Medical Foundation which let’s me send a message to a doctor about a problem/symptoms and they often respond promptly and with helpful advice. It doesn’t always save me a trip to their office but it is a nice feature”</q>
      </div>

      <div class="mySlides">
        <q>“I don’t like to call into anywhere for an appointment in general because it can be time consuming. But I almost always call before going to the Health Center to see if I can avoid busy periods”</q>
      </div>

      <div class="mySlides">
        <q>“The Health Center just feels like an outdated facility. If it had a modern app, I think others would feel more confident and comfortable going there because it would suggest that the center is up-to-date with technology”</q>
      </div>

      <div class="mySlides">
        <q>“I’ve been to the Health Center about 2 times during each of my 5 years at Cal Poly. Out of all those times, never was I able to get an online appointment during the date that worked for me because a doctor was unavailable. I don’t know if it’s because I’m using the portal wrong, but it’s super frustrating”</q>
      </div>

      <div class="mySlides">
        <q>“I don’t go to the Health Center unless I absolutely have to. It would be interesting if I could use a virtual doctor because then I could talk with a doctor before I’m dying and possibly get diagnosed before it gets horrible”</q>
      </div>

      <div class="mySlides">
        <q>“I’m constantly on the go so when I get sick I just want to schedule an appointment then show up without having to wait forever”</q>

    <h4>Persona</h4>
    <p>We created a persona based on the themes uncovered during our interviews. The typical individual we interviewed didn't regulary visit the Health Center but when they needed to, it was critical that they could easily schedule an appointment since they're busy.</p>

    <h4>Scenario</h4>
    <p>Sarah Rivers is a third year philosophy major at Cal Poly. She is very organized and likes to plan out her week ahead of time in her planner. Every second of her day is filled with class, studying, or appointments. Sarah has been having a very busy winter quarter. Aside from being enrolled in 16 units, she is once again working part-time as an administrative assistant for the philosophy department, where she is often in contact with multiple students. Her high stress makes her an easy target for this years flu season, and she soon finds herself experiencing a fever and cough that just won’t go away.</p>
    <p>Sarah is not a fan of the Health Center on campus: she has had trouble scheduling an appointment, knows first-hand how long a wait for a walk-in can be, and feels the facility is outdated. But her symptoms have worsened, and since she realizes her tution won’t cover a visit to the local hospital, she decides a visit to the Health Center is necessary.</p>
    <p>Sarah learns that the Health & Wellbeing Center has just created a new app that allows for easy scheduling. She is skeptical but she downloads the app and easily logs in using his regular Cal Poly portal information. She’s able to find the appointment scheduling page then selects a date and time that works for her. Sarah arrives at the Health Center and learns she can now directly check-in through the app and complete any required forms. She’s able to get in and out of the Health Center within 30 minutes because of the app which would have typically taken her 2-3 hours otherwise.</p>

    <h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
    <p>After learning the major goals and frusterations our users, we decided to prioritize the features for the minium viable product based on our users.</p>
    <picture><img src="images/polyhealth_mvp.jpg" alt="PolyHealth+ Feature Prioritization"></picture>

    <div class="space"></div>

    <h4>User Flow</h4>
    <p>Based on our feature prioritization, we create a user flow for the minimum viable products for the new PolyHealth+ app.</p>

    <div class="space"></div>

    <h4>Guerilla Test</h4>
    <p>To quickly test the usability of our app, we used guerilla testing with 3 users to identify any major issues. Most users found that the app was very intuitive, but there was an issue where users had to go through too many screens to see already scheduled appointments. We also decided to remove the confirmation screen to reduce number of taps.</p>

    <h4>User Testing</h4>
    <p>We had 6 individuals test our low-fi prototype of the Cal Poly Health Center app. Individuals were given a brief overview of what they'd be doing along with specific tasks that we were testing. The overview and tasks are shown below.</p>

    <h4>User Overview</h4>
    <p>We are designing an app that helps users easily schedule and manage appointments at the Cal Poly Health Center. The app also includes multiple other features to make it more accessible to students on the go. We will not be testing you, we will only be testing the system to make sure it is easy to use and user friendly.</p>

    <h4>User Scenario & Tasks</h4>
    <p style="margin-bottom: .65em;">You are starting to feel sick and after a couple of hours you decide you need to go to the Health Center. You’re dreading it because of the wait time and you know it’s difficult to schedule appointments using the portal. Your roommate tells you about the Health Center’s new app that allows you to easily schedule appointments so you decide to try it out.</p>
    <p><strong>Task 1</strong> – Use the app to schedule an appointment.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: .65em;">A day later you realize you had an important group meeting and you need to reschedule your appointment with the Health Center.</p>
    <p><strong>Task 2</strong> – Use the app to change the appointment.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: .65em;">You arrive at the Health Center for your appointment and there’s a sign notifying you that you can now check in using the new app.</p>
    <p><strong>Task 3</strong> – Use the app to check in for your appointment.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="problem" style="background-color: #26CD7A; text-align: center;">
      <div class="container-portfolio-color" style="background-color: #26CD7A;">

        <h4 style="color: white;">Results</h4>
        <h1 style="font-size: 5em;">100%</h1>
        <p class="italic" style="color: white;">users completed all tasks</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container-portfolio">
    <h4>Key Findings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Users wanted to be able to get home easily instead of pressing the back button multiple times.</li>
      <li>Users were curious if after they checked-in, did the "estimated waiting time" update to reflect their specific time or remain the general walk-in time</li>
      <li>6 out of 6 users tested found the app well-organized and intuitive.</li>
      <li>5 out of 6 users tested would promote this application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Critical Usability Issues</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In the verification section under check-in, it is not immediately obvious that an unchecked selection can be edited by tapping it (i.e. users were expecting it to function like a selection bubble).</li>
      <li>Some users were worried that filling out a long/detailed health history form may be too tedious on a small mobile screen.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="space"></div>

    <h4>Mood-board & Branding</h4>
    <p>We created a general mood-board to determine the visual design aspects of the app. We wanted to keep the design clean and modern looking using Google's material design as a reference. We also wanted to keep it true to Cal Poly by using a softer yet vibrant green as an accent color. Our logo is based off of the Cal Poly mascot, the mustang, and a stethoscope to represent a doctor. </p>
