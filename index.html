      <h3>Douglas Harrington DDS</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container-right">
      <p>Dr. Harrington is a pediatric and orthodontic dentist who needed a new logo as he was moving to a new office. He wanted an aeronautical feel so I incorporated wings. I used the smile shape as the crossbar on the H to show they are a dentist.</p>

    <div class="container-right">
      <p><a href="http://flowersbykim.com" target="_blank">Flowers by Kim</a> is an exclusive wedding and event florist in Paso Robles, California. I designed the logo and website with a minimalist style. This allows you to easily add the logo to anything or put anything on the website to bring out the natural beauty in flowers.</p>

      <h3>Lahargou Farms</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container-right">
      <p>Lahargou Farms sells eggs and chickens so they wanted a simple logo that could place on any of their packaging, labels, and apparel. I also created a potential website design when they were prepared to have an online presence.</p>

      <h3>Haymaker Inn</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container-right">
      <p>The Haymaker Inn is a Paso Robles, California vacation rental in the heart of vineyards. I created a script logo to reflect the high end feel yet in the middle of the country. Along with the logo I created a 10 page travel guide which includes information about the house, places to eat, things to do, and winery tour information.</p>
