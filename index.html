      <h3>Douglas Harrington DDS</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container-right">
      <p>Dr. Harrington is a pediatric and orthodontic dentist who needed a new logo as he was moving to a new office. He wanted an aeronautical feel so I incorporated wings. I used the smile shape as the crossbar on the H to show they are a dentist.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="container-right">
      <p>Lahargou Farms mainly sells eggs so the client wanted a simple logo that he could place on any of his packaging, labels, and apparel. I used a bold sans-serif typeface along with a simple icon so it could be easily read, even on an egg.</p>
