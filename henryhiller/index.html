      <h3>HENRY WINANS HILLER</h3>
      <h1>PIONEER OF RUSSO-AMERICAN TRADE</h1>
      <p>The study of Americans in Russia has little documentation of the American experience, and even littler comprehensive history. Limited information is available, with the exception of a meager amount of material largely of an accidental or secondary nature; also, the actual number of such journeys in the eighteenth and nineteenth century could not have been significant. A journey to America by a Russian or by an American to Russia was neither easy nor safe.

      Travelers had to conquer enormous distances, assess complex political situations, and confront unknown conditions. No wonder that in overcoming all these obstacles, they rarely took care to preserve their impressions for historians. We know virtually nothing about some of them, others have left fragmentary, at times unreliable and self-contradictory records.

      However, Hiller was one for documentation. Not only was he able to keep, and then later donate his materials to various archives, he also took and stored hundreds of glass plate photographs, allowing  historians to better understand what an American’s experience in Russia was truly like.

      These glass plate negatives were photographed on a dry plate, as opposed to its predecessor the collodion plate, and were both easier to use and travel with.</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Henry Winans Hiller was an American businessman and pioneer of Russo-American maritime trade, born in the Hudson Valley in 1838. In June of 1851, at the age of 13, he set on his first expedition on the Maria Theresa which would define the rest of his future. On his first voyage as a cabin boy on the whaler, he was stranded in Siberia where he learned the Russian language. It was this that established Hiller as a crucial element in creating ties, both economically and politically, from America to Russia. Over the next forty years, Hiller worked for the Boston Mercantile House, as the U.S. Consul to Russia during the Lincoln administration, and finished his career with Tiffany and Co. as a precious gem and metal trader. </p>
